Hi! I'm Tom

I'm passionate about the idea that technology can be used for the benefit of us all, and like to focus on open source projects that make a positive impact on peoples lives.

I am primarily a dotnet engineer and starting my journey into building devops and automation skills, but I have dabbled in Java, Python, C++, swift and more.
